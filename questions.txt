Open main1.py. Before running it, what do you expect this program to do? 
I have no clue.
Now right click on the window and select “Run Python File in Terminal”. Click in the bottom panel, and answer the question. Describe what happened. 
It asked me "What is my favorite color?".
What do you think the program did with what you typed?
It put Greetings, regardless of anything else and then asked as input, but didn't ask for any output.


Open main2.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main1.py. 
There is an additional line to main2.py and more added to the last line of main1.py
What do you think the color = input() will do? 
I believe it will allow you to answer what the favorite color is
Run the program in the terminal and answer the question. Did the program do what you expected?
It allowed me to answer this time, but didn't tell me if it was right or not.


Open main3.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main2.py. 
It has a way to tell me if I am right or wrong with the answer I put.
What is happening on lines 11–14? 
It has what the computer will tell me for any answer I say for the question. It organizes it in such a way that no matter what I write, it will tell me if I am write or not.
Why are lines 12 and 14 indented? 
To organize and separate what the computer will tell me. They are indented due to the line before them being answers I might say and lines 12 and 14 are the answers to my answer.
Run the program and answer the question. What happens if you don’t capitalize Red? 
It says it's wrong.
What does this tell you about "color"?
The color is not shown, but read as any other word. I believe the computer itself does not possess the knowledge that Red and red are the same thing despite one having a captitalized letter


Open main4.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main2.py. 

What problem is this trying to solve? 

Run the program and answer the question. What happens if you use some other capitalization scheme (i.e., “RED” or “reD“)?



Open main5.py. What do you expect line 11 to do? 

What problem is it trying to solve? 

Run the program and answer the question. What happens if you add spaces before or after the word (i.e., “  RED  “ or “ red”)?



Open main6.py. How is line 11 different than main5.py? 

What would you guess .strip() is doing? 

Run the program and answer the question. Is there another way of writing “red” that will break this logic?



Open main7.py. Before running this program, how do you expect this to be different than main6.py? 

What is the purpose of line 11? 

Run the program and answer the question.



Open main8.py. What is the purpose of line 11? 

Why are lines 12–19 indented? 

Run the program. What would happen if line 12 were moved before line 11 (and no longer indented)? 

Make that change and run the program again. To end any Python program, you can type ctrl-c.



Open main9.py. What is happening on line 12? 

What is the purpose of “count”? 

What is happening on line 22?
